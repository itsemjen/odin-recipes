    <h4>I found many recipes for broccoli Cheddar soup. I changed many of the ingredients in those recipes. This is the recipe I came up with. It's the best one yet. You don't need all the extra ingredients to make it. Just basic ingredients. and it's delicious. I think it tastes just like PaneraÂ®.</h4>
